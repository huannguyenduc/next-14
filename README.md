## Quick Start

# ðŸŽ¯ Step By Step Guide

## Clean-Up & Simple Run

Clean up the files from the example repository and do not forget to install the dependencies
There is a good example by default on `HomeScreen`. You can delete the all screens.

- `yarn`
- `yarn clean-up`
- `yarn && yarn dev`

## Husky Integration

Before doing anything else, please simply run the command to initalize the husky. If you do not run clean-up part you should run the husky setup by yourself

```jsx
npm run husky:setup
```

`husky:setup` will handle the initialization, installation and ready to use `commitlint`, `prettier` and `eslint`.
